C programs to demonstrate compilation pipeline.

It can print fibonacci number and reverse string, or either of these tasks, depending upon the compilation and command-line arguments provided.


Compilation can be done with this command:

gcc -Wall fibeverse.c reverse.c fibonacci.c -o fibeverse

Program can be rum with two arguments: a number, then a string (in quotes).

The first line prints fibonacci number. Second line gives the string provided, with words reversed. Makefile performs this task.


When compiled with this command, it computes only the Fibonacci number:

gcc -Wall -DFIBONACCI fibeverse.c reverse.c fibonacci.c -o fibonacci

and can be run like this:

./fibonacci 8


When compiled as follows, it reverses the string provided as first argument:

gcc -Wall -DREVERSE fibeverse.c reverse.c fibonacci.c -o reverse

and can be run like this:

./reverse 'a brave new world'


It works normally when both compiler flags are provided:

gcc -Wall -DFIBONACCI -DREVERSE fibeverse.c reverse.c fibonacci.c -o fibeverse
