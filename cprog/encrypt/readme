C program to encrypt and decrypt messages using a passkey.

You can choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.

If you wish to encrypt, enter the message and provide a passkey. The encrypted message will then be written to the file "output.txt".

If you wish to decrypt, just provide the correct passkey and the encrypted code in "output.txt" will be decrypted and displayed.
