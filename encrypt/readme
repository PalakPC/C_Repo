C program to encrypt and decrypt messages using passkey.

You can choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.

If you want to encrypt, enter the message and provide a passkey. The encrypted message will then be written to the file "output.txt".

If you want to decrypt, just provide the passkey and the encrypted code in "output.txt" will be decrypted and displayed.
